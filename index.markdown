           <p>My name is Samantha Zgak, and I am a 27 year old college student. I am currently attending Eastern Washington University majoring in Visual Communication Design with a minor in Art. In the near future I will be able to recieve a double major in Communications. My main objectives are to graduate, and hopefully be able to get a job in multiple fields of design so that I can learn and grow to eventually work for gaming or film industries. For now I am considering staying in Spokane, and maybe someday I will venture out depending on where I can find the job that is right for me.</p>
           <p>I love to game, read, and dabble in everything that is artistic. Ever since middle school I have had an afinity for drawing, and throughout the years I have pushed myself to become better at it. Pretty much if I can see it I can draw it. It was this love for graphite and paper that origionally led me to Visual Communication Design, and honestly the possible ability to work for gaming companies makes it just that much better.</p>
           <p>Another thing that I highly enjoy is working with people to make visually compelling pieces of art. I have been told that I am quite the people person and have the ability to work not only as a leader but a great member of a team as well. I love having the input and critiques that come with working in a group because it helps me to grow and learn as a designer.</p>
